      <t>This memo proposes a (set of) entry(ies) for the Performance Metric
      Registry, based on Model-Based Metrics (MBM). It uses terms and

      <t>This document defines one of the initial set of Performance Metrics
      Registry entries, for which IETF approval (following development in the
      IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Working Group) will satisfy the
      requirement for Expert Review. Note that all are Active Performance
      Metrics, which are based on RFCs prepared in the IPPM working group of
      the IETF, according to their framework <xref target="RFC2330"/> and its
      updates.</t>

          <t>Mathis, M. and A. Morton, "Model Based Metrics for Bulk Transport
          Capacity", draft-ietf-ippm-model-based- metrics-10 (work in
          progress), February 2017.</t>

          <t>The primary metrics of measurement are round-trip delay and
          one-way loss, measured under the conditions described in Section
          8.5.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-model-based-metrics"/>.</t>

          <t>For loss:</t>

          <t>Almes, G., Kalidini, S., Zekauskas, M., and A. Morton, Ed., "A
          One-Way Loss Metric for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)", RFC 7680,
          DOI 10.17487/RFC7680, January 2016,
          &lt;http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7680&gt;. </t>

          <t>Section 2.4 of <xref target="RFC7680"/> provides the reference
          definition of the singleton (single value) one-way loss metric.
          Section 3.4 of <xref target="RFC7680"/> provides the reference
          definition expanded to cover a multi-singleton sample. Note that
          terms such as singleton and sample are defined in Section 11 of
          <xref target="RFC2330"/>.</t>

          <t>For round-trip delay:</t>

          <t>Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M. Zekauskas, "A One-way Packet
          Loss Metric for IPPM", RFC 2680, September 1999.</t>

          <t><xref target="RFC2681"/></t>

          <t>Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., Zekauskas, M., and A. Morton, Ed., "A
          One-Way Delay Metric for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)", STD 81, RFC
          7679, DOI 10.17487/RFC7679, January 2016,
          &lt;http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7679&gt;.</t>

          <t><xref target="RFC7679"/></t>

          <t>&lt;specific section reference and additional clarifications, if
          needed&gt;</t>

          <t>Section 2.4 of <xref target="RFC2681"/> provides the reference
          definition of the singleton (single value) Round-trip delay metric.
          Section 3.4 of <xref target="RFC2681"/> provides the reference
          definition expanded to cover a multi-singleton sample. Note that
          terms such as singleton and sample are defined in Section 11 of
          <xref target="RFC2330"/>.</t>

          <t>Note that although the definition of "Round-trip-Delay between
          Src and Dst" is directionally ambiguous in the text, this metric
          tightens the definition further to recognize that the host in the
          "Src" role will send the first packet to "Dst", and ultimately
          receive the corresponding return packet from "Dst" (when neither are
          lost).</t>

          <t>Finally, note that the variable "dT" is used in <xref
          target="RFC2681"/> to refer to the value of Round-trip delay in
          metric definitions and methods. The variable "dT" has been re-used
          in other IPPM literature to refer to different quantities, and
          cannot be used as a global variable name here.</t>

          <t>@@@@ I strongly suggest decimal64 fraction digits = 9 or 12
	  (i.e nanoseconds or picoseconds).  I point out that the average

	  In either case for decimal64 the max headway is way longer than
	  ever needed (decades or months). --MM--
	  (@@@@ BTW I think your fraction digits are off --MM--).

	  <t>@@@@ This section has a general problem that it need to better prescribe

      <t>The authors thank Brian Trammell for suggesting the term "Run-time

      parameters implemented in this memo, for identifying the IPFIX metric
      with Flow Key as an example, and for many other productive suggestions.
      Thanks to Peter Koch, who provided several useful suggestions for
      disambiguating successive DNS Queries in the DNS Response time
      metric.</t>

      <t>The authors also acknowledge the constructive reviews and helpful
      suggestions from Barbara Stark, Juergen Schoenwaelder, Tim Carey, and
